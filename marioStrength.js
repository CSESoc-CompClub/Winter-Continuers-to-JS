/*Your first array exercise!!

You have been given two arrays: one that corresponds to the names of each character, while the
other array contains information about their RESPECTIVE strength levels. For example, Toad
would directly correspond to a strength of 3. 

Your task:
    Find and print the characters with maximum and minimum strength
    in the form:
        Strongest: Princess Daisy, 9
        Weakest: Yoshi, 7
        Weakest: Mario, 7
    (these are only PLACEHOLDER names and values, your own solution will differ)
*/


const characters = ['Mario', 'Princess Peach', 'Toad', 'Princess Daisy', 'Luigi', 'Bowser'];
const strength = [6, 7, 3, 5, 7, 3];
